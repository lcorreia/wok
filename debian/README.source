This package is being improved and was split from kimchi package, which was
being tracked at:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=772823

This builds wok-dev package necessary for building wok plugins (kimchi, ginger,
ginger-base).

We don't verify upstream source tarball as upstream don't sign releases.

override_dh_auto_test is used to skip tests as testing implies creating users
with correct permissions which is not always possible depending on the build
environment/host.
